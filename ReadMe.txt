OVERVIEW:

Simple regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two variables.

In this example, we have some existing data (Excel sheet) that has 2 variables. 

Variable 1 = Years of Experience
Variable 2 = Salary

In other words,

Variable 1 is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
Variable 2 is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.


WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO:

This script would perform a simple regression on the data supplied (in the Excel sheet where we have recorded data that maps salary to years of experience) and the outcome generated is a regression model. In this case, this helps in predicting the salary for a person with "x" years of experience.
